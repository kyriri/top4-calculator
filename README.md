# T.O.P : Calculator
The Odin Project's 4th assignment: build an on-screen calculator

Features required by the assignment:
1. Ability to add, substract, multiply and divide
2. Ability to restart the calculator

Optional features also implemented:
3. Ability to input decimal numbers
4. Ability to erase the last input
5. Keyboard support

As an exercise, I experimented with using vh as my only styling unit â€” that leads to a design that refits automatically (and proportionally) to the height of the screen.
