# T.O.P : Calculator
The Odin Project's Foundation Path - [4th assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator): build an on-screen calculator.

### Features required by the assignment:
- [x] Ability to add, substract, multiply and divide
- [x] No use of `eval()`
- [x] Ability to restart the calculator

### Optional features:
- [x] Ability to input decimal numbers
- [x] Ability to erase the last input
- [x] Keyboard support

As an exercise, I experimented with using the unit vh as my only styling unit â€” that led to a design that refits automatically and proportionally to the height of the screen.

Also as an exercise, I created a spec file (my first) to test the main calculation function. Eventually, I found out it would have been more helpful to have concentrated on testing some other functions on the code, but, well, that's learning.
