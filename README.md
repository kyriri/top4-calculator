# T.O.P : Calculator
The Odin Project's 4th assignment: build an on-screen calculator

## Features required by the assignment:
- [x] Ability to add, substract, multiply and divide
- [x] Ability to restart the calculator

## Optional features:
- [x] Ability to input decimal numbers
- [x] Ability to erase the last input
- [x] Keyboard support

As an exercise, I experimented with using vh as my only styling unit â€” that led to a design that refits automatically and proportionally to the height of the screen.

Also as an exercise, I created a spec file (my first) to test the main calculation function. Eventually, I found out it would have been more helpful to have concentrated on testing some other functions on the code, but, well, that's learning.
